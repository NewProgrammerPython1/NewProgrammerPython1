welcome to my bio! I'm panha, but you can call me 'pah' since thats what everyone outside of my country calls me lol.

i'm a middle schooler that's pretty much getting back into programming after taking months of break lol. (though I wouldn't say I'm great at any languages or anything)

experiences: abit of html (freeCodeCamp), scratch, and a little bit of python (aswell as a little bit of turtle).
